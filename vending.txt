Fairness.

Ratio of input quantity to output quantity offerred has to be less than or equal to the ratio of input quantity to output quantity bid for all input/output pairs.

So if you're selling 1 gram of gold for 30 dollars plus 10 asset tokens, and I offer 32 dollars plus 12 asset tokens for 0.8 grams of gold, the trade would go through:

Offered:
30 / 1 = 30
10 / 1 = 10

Bid:
32 / 0.8 = 40
12 / 0.8 = 15

30 < 40 & 10 < 15

However, if I offer 32 dollars plus 7 asset tokens for 0.8 grams of gold, the trade would NOT go through.

32 / 0.8 = 40
7 / 0.8 = 8.75

30 < 40, but 10 > 8.75

Additionally, you have to be able to satisfy at least all the output amounts listed in the bid (this could be one of a chain of bids that the client has put together).

Different representation:

Input:
(
:function
=defvend
:input
=30:<dollars> 10:<usage tokens>
:output
=1:<gold grams>
:id
=<public id>
:key
=<key>
:inv
=<inventory location>
)

Output: echo of input, plus status (OK or Error)


Input:
(
:function
=queryvend
:id
=<public id>
)

Output:

(
:function
=queryvend
:id
=<public id>
:input
=30:<dollars> 10:<usage tokens>
:output
=1:<gold grams>
:status
=<OK or error type>
)

Include the key in queryvend and you'll get the inventory location out.

Input:
(:function
=vend
:input
=30:<dollars> 10:<usage tokens>
:output
=1:<gold grams>
:id
=<public id>
:loc
=<trading location>
)

Output:
(:function
=vend
:input
=30:<dollars> 10:<usage tokens>
:output
=1:<gold grams>
:id
=<public id>
:loc
=<trading location>
:count
=<Number of quanta satisfied>
:status
=<OK or error type>
)
