This page contains information about Patrick Chkeroff's
<a href="http://loom.cc/">Loom</a> anonymous electronic trading system.
<p>
My blog has a
<a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/categories/loom">Loom
Category</a>, which contains all the articles I've writen about
Loom. The last time I updated this page, those were:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/loom_electronic_accounting_system.html">
Loom Electronic Accounting System</a> - an overview with links to
tutorials and resources. I've since decided that "electronic trading
system" is a better name.</li>
<li><a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/loom_security.html">
Loom Security</a> - my analysis of the security of the algorithms and
database used by version 58 of the loom.cc source code.</li>
<li><a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/creating_your_own_loom_currency.html">
Creating Your Own Loom Currency</a> - an idea for keeping track of how
much reserve of a real asset you have versus how much electronic
currency you've issued backed by that asset.</li>
<li><a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/patricks_loom_issuance_scheme.html">
Patrick's Loom Issuance Scheme</a> - a better idea for tracking
reserve assets.
<li><a href="http://billstclair.com/blog/loom_three_folder_issuer_protocol.html">
Loom Three-folder Issuer Protocol</a> - an even better idea for
tracking reserve assets.
</ul>
<p>
My PHP version of Patrick's
<a href="https://loom.cc/?function=grid_tutorial&mode=advanced">
Grid Tutorial</a> is
<a href="grid-tutorial.php">here</a>. The tutorial is an example of
using my LoomClient PHP class. I have also written a LoomClient Java
class, with a simple command line testing interface. Its JavaDoc pages
are
<a href="java/doc/">here</a>.

Download this
entire directory, including all the sources and Java binaries, at
<a href="../loomclient.tar.gz">loomclient.tar.gz</a>
<p>
You can browse my
<a href="http://git.or.cz/">
Git</a> repository of the source at
<a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/loomclient.git">
repo.or.cz/w/loomclient.git</a>. To check out your own copy:
<blockquote><code>
    mkdir loomclient<br>
    cd loomclient<br>
    git init<br>
    git pull git://repo.or.cz/loomclient.git
</blockquote></code>
